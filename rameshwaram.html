                    According to the Ramayana, Rama is described to have built a bridge from the region approximating this town across the sea to Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from her abductor Ravana. The temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, is at the centre of the town and is closely associated with Rama and Shiva. The temple and the town are considered a holy pilgrimage site for Shaivas and Vaishnavas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rameswaram means "Lord of Rama" (Rāma-īśvaram) in Sanskrit, an epithet of Shiva, the presiding deity of the Ramanathaswamy Temple.According to Hindu epic Ramayana, Rama, the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu, prayed to Shiva here to absolve any sins that he might have committed during his war against the demon-king Ravana in Sri Lanka.

    <strong>Devotional Importance:</strong>
    <p>Rameswaram is important for many Hindus as a pilgrimage to Varanasi is considered to be incomplete without a
        pilgrimage to Rameswaram. The town along with the Ramanathaswamy temple is one of the holiest Hindu Char
        Dham (four divine sites) sites comprising Badrinath, Puri and Dwarka.</p>
    <p>Though ideologically the temples are divided between the sects of Hinduism, namely Saivism and Vaishnavism,
        the Char Dham pilgrimage is all Hindu affairs. The journey across the four cardinal points in India is
        considered sacred by Hindus who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetime. Traditionally the trip
        starts at the eastern end from Puri, proceeding in clockwise direction in a manner typically followed for
        circumambulation in Hindu temples.

  <strong>Festivals</strong>
  <div>
    <strong>Mahashivaratri</strong>
    <p>The Rameshwaram Temple is linked with the journey of Lord Rama to Lanka to rescue Sita from Ravana. It is said that it was at Rameshwaram that Lord Rama's 'Vanar Sena' or the army of monkeys built a bridge to reach Lanka. Legend has it that Lord Rama had made a 'lingam' made of sand here, dedicated to Lord Shiva. He had worshipped it to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva to vanquish Ravana. The day of Mahashivratri is celebrated all across the country at 'Jyotirlingas', or shrines of Lord Shiva where the deity is worshipped in the form of a 'Jyotirlinga'. Devotees believe that Lord Shiva entered into wedlock with Goddess Parvati on this day to save civilisation from darkness and disharmony. The 'Great Night of Shiva' or Mahashivratri is celebrated with great pomp and show at the Rameshwaram Temple. The festivities last over ten days. Pageants of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati emerge from the temple. Visit Rameshwaram during Mahashivratri to witness the spectacle. It is usually held sometime between the months of February and March.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <strong>Navratri and Dussehra</strong>
    <p>Navratri marks the period of nine nights and ten days when Goddess Durga is worshiped. Celebrated as per the Hindu almanac, it falls in the months of September and October. The festivities culminate with Dussehra. Sri Chakra or the sacred symbol of Shakti is brought out once a year during this time for viewing. Dussehra marks the end of the evil King Ravana and symbolises the triumph of good over evil.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <strong>Thirukalyanam</strong>
    <p>Held during the 'maas' or month of 'Jyeshta' as per the Indian calendar, it takes place in the months of July and August. It is one of the longest festivals in Rameshwaram, lasting for seventeen days. Thirukalyanam is celebrated to commemorate the marriage of Lord Ramanatha and Goddess Parvatavardhini. Turn up in Rameshwaram during this time and you will see processions and many cultural programmes held across the temple town.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <strong>The festival of RamaLinga Pratishtha</strong>
    <p>It is believed that Sita had built a Shiva Linga at Rameshwaram with her own hands out of sand. This was because Hanuman who had been dispatched to Mount Kailash to fetch a Shiva Lingam had not been able to return on time. Upon the advice of Rishi Agashthya, Lord Rama worshiped the Shiva Linga built by Sita to complete certain special rituals within a specified auspicious hour. Ramalinga Pratishtha is the day that celebrates the installation of the Shiva Linga by Sita. Processions fill the streets of Rameshwaram and carry the idols of Lord Ramanathaswamy.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <strong>The festival of Arudhra Darshanam</strong>
    <p>Celebrated over a period of 10 days, the festival of Arudhra Darshanam usually takes place in the months of December and January. From your Rameshwaram hotel, plan a visit to watch the unveiling of 'Nataraj' during this time. Covered in sandalwood paste for the rest of the year, viewing this unveiling is considered auspicious.</p>
